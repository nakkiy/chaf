# **`chaf`** ‚Äì Not a finder. A *filter*.

---

## ‚ú® What is **chaf**?

**chaf** is a text filtering tool with the following features:

1. Logical expressions for condition specification  
1. Instead of "searching" like `grep`, it "excludes" specified lines  
1. Supports standard input/output, making it pipe-friendly  
1. Uses stdin when no input file is provided  
1. Invert exclusion with `--invert` to act like `grep`  
1. Display summary report with `--report`  
1. Not as fast as `grep`, but can process ~10 million lines in a few seconds  

---

## üí° Why was it created?

While `grep -v` is convenient, expressing complex exclusion rules becomes unreadable.  
For example: "Exclude `DEBUG`, but keep `[DEBUG] connect DB`"  
Such conditions are difficult to express clearly with `grep`.

**chaf** lets you write exclusion logic with logical expressions ‚Äî a filter *dedicated to exclusion*.

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Usage

```bash
## üñ•Ô∏è Example Usage

```bash
$ cat logs.txt
error: failed to connect
warn: deprecated API used
debug: retrying connection
info: connection established
warn: low disk space
error: timeout while waiting for response

# Lines containing "debug" or "warn" are excluded
$ chaf 'debug | warn' logs.txt
error: failed to connect
info: connection established
error: timeout while waiting for response

# Excludes:
# - Lines containing "debug"
# - Lines containing "warn" unless they also contain "API"
$ chaf 'debug | (warn & !API)' logs.txt
error: failed to connect
warn: deprecated API used
info: connection established
error: timeout while waiting for response
# Explanation:
# ‚Üí "warn: low disk space" is excluded (no "API")
# ‚Üí "warn: deprecated API used" is kept (contains "API")

# Invert mode: show only lines that match the condition
# Includes:
# - Lines containing "debug"
# - Lines containing "warn" unless they also contain "API"
$ chaf --invert 'debug | (warn & !API)' logs.txt
debug: retrying connection
warn: low disk space
```

| `aaa & bbb`                      | AND ‚Äî match lines containing both `aaa` and `bbb` (exclude)   |
| `aaa \| bbb`                     | OR ‚Äî match lines containing either `aaa` or `bbb` (exclude)   |
| `!aaa`                           | NOT ‚Äî match lines not containing `aaa` (exclude)              |
